            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            Hi! I'm Finn and welcome to the 3D printing section. If you are a fan of <br>
            super cool machinery that can make even cooler stuff, you are definitely <br>
             in the right place. <br>


             <img src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/3Dverse/Printer.jpg">
             <br>
             I first got into 3D Printing a few years ago. I was an amateur and didn't <br>
             even know what 
             <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code" target="_top">G-code</a> 
             was. But, over time I have learned and now I <br>
             can't live without the soft humming of the motors in the background.

             <br><br>

             I think the reason I love 3D printing so much is the endless possibilities. <br>
             Seriously, you can print anything from models of your favourite movie <br>
             characters that chill on your desk to real articulated prints that can move <br>
             freely and entertain your younger siblings for hours and hours.<br>
             <img src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/3Dverse/Characters.jpg">
             <br>
             We don't even just do models to lay on your desk, either!<br>
             if you have read the <a href="Resin.html">Resin Section</a>, you might know that we make<br>
             keyrings out of 3D prints too!<br>
             Are you the type of person who's always in the mood for a selfie?<br>
             Or maybe you just love sitting back and being able to watch your favouritemshows anywhere?<br>
             Well, I think you'll love the phone stand keyring!<br>

             <br><br>
             I'm hoping to show you how cool 3D printing is and what you can do with <br>
             it at my stall.

            <h2>How does it all work?</h2>

            Well, when I first discovered 3D printing, it seemed like magic so I'm <br>
            gonna try and simplify it as much as possible.

            *Inhale*

            Sadly, a 3D printer can't just produce things out of nowhere. We need to <br>
            load a reel of plastic into the printer.<br><br>

            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/3Dverse/Filament.jpg"><br>
            This plastic is called filament and we use a motor to force this filament <br>
            through a tube and into a thing called a hotend.<br><br>

            <img src="file:///C:/Users/Owner/Documents/3Dverse/Annotations.jpg"><br>
            The hotend heats it and pushes it out of a nozzle. When it comes out, <br>
            it cools and becomes hard. We move the hotend using motors while this <br>
            happens and make 1 layer. We stack a bunch of layers and get a 3D print!<br>
            <br>

            Well, at the stall, we have dozens of models but here are the ones I find <br>
            the coolest:

            maybe drop by!
